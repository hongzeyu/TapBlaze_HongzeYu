TapBlaze SpinWheel Test - Hongze Yu

Completed 09/06/2021

Several alterations to sample video:

1. Made text black;
2. Made resolution 10:16
3. The background image was not provided so I used a similar one
4. The game is made in Unity version 2019.4.18f1, though it is likely to be usable with other versions.
5. I accomodated positioning of UI towards the device simulator, so in the "game" window it may look a bit awkward.
